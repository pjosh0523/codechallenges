/*Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.*/
//use the tostring method and put in 2 as the radix because 2 represents binary

function addBinary(a,b){
    return (a+b).toString(2)
